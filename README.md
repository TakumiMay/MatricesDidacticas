# MatricesDidacticas

This project was developed inside the AED course from ICESI University. 
The objective of this project is to create an animated matrix with the dimensions entered by the user.
The matrix will generate a random value in each cell, so when the user presses the left click on the matrix; it will start an animation that highlights cell by cell. This animation sums up the values of the highlighted cells.
The result of the sum will be updating constantly while the animation is in progress.
