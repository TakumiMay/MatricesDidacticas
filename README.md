# MatricesDidacticas
Group 2

This project was developed in the AED course at ICESI University. 
The objective of this project is to create an animated matrix with the dimensions that the user input.
The matrix will generate a random value in each cell, so when the user presses the right click over the matrix; it will start an animation that moves cell by cell. This animation sums up the values of the highlighted cells.
The result of the sum will be updating constantly while the animation is in progress.
